    "description": "Hocari is based on two things, first of all its a startup. Secondly, we are building a proof-of-ownership platform which rewards users based on their token balance and their ownership duration. The more tokens they own and the longer they hold them the more discounts they will receive on various products and services, like streaming subscriptions. Today, we are developing a platform through which users can create an ID for their wallet and view there staking positions and view their score. We think this project has a great potential. ",
